	<h1> MChat Help </h1>
	
	<p>MChat is a simple program that allows two people connected to an Ethernet network to chat with each other. <br>
	   Among its main features is the fact that conversations are direct and leave no trace. <br>
       Each message sent is encrypted and then decrypted upon arrival using a special key. <br>
       However this mechanism cannot avoid other control methods such as software that <br>
       monitor the typing of keys.<br>
	</p>
	
	<h2> Use </h2>
	<p>  
       Computers that need to come into contact must be on the same network. <br>
	   The work directory is C:\MChat there the program write all preferences but not chat discussions. <br>
	   You can set your server and users preferences with preferences-panel.<br>
	   Server and PC names are case sensitive.<br>       
	   
	   The linking mechanism is as follows:<br>
	   <ul>
		 <li>One of the two interlocutors must listen, so he must act only on the "Server" connection button. In server mode the program waits for a call</li>
	     <li>The other party must select from the list the name of the server and the name of PC that is listening and press the "Call" button</li>
	     <li>At this point, once the connection is established, the interlocutors can chat between them</li>
		 <li>Whoever acts as a server can open multiple instances of MChat and, by activating different servers, communicate with multiple clients. The conversation always remains one to one. </li>
	   </ul>
	   
	   It is possible to cancel the chat either through the relative button or with the F1 function key.<br>
	   Warning! This cleaning acts only on one's "blackboard" and not on that of the interlocutor.<br>
	   Is is possible to hide MChat into systray with F2 function key.<br>
